The physics-based feature engineering approach incorporates fundamental principles of biomechanics and motion dynamics to enhance player movement prediction accuracy. This methodology leverages established physical constraints and kinematic relationships to create more realistic and interpretable features.

## Kinematic Constraints and Feasibility Analysis

The implementation enforces realistic human performance limits through feasibility scoring. Speed feasibility is computed as:

$$\text{speed\_feasibility} = \min\left(\frac{v}{v_{\max}}, 1.0\right)$$

where $v_{\max} = 12.0$ m/s represents the maximum sustainable speed for elite NFL players. Similarly, acceleration feasibility uses $a_{\max} = 8.0$ m/s².

## Momentum and Energy Dynamics

Classical mechanics principles are applied to derive momentum and kinetic energy features. The momentum vector components are calculated as:

$$\vec{p} = m \vec{v} = m(v_x, v_y)$$

where $m$ represents player mass and $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector. The kinetic energy follows the standard formulation:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}m|\vec{v}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2 + v_y^2)$$

## Trajectory Curvature Analysis

For curved motion analysis, the centripetal acceleration is estimated using the relationship between total acceleration and velocity direction:

$$a_c = a \sin(\theta_v)$$

where $\theta_v = \arctan(v_y/v_x)$ is the velocity angle. The turning radius follows from circular motion dynamics:

$$R = \frac{|\vec{v}|^2}{|a_c|}$$

This provides insight into the sharpness of directional changes and movement patterns.

## Predictive Motion Modeling

Two predictive models are implemented for future position estimation. The linear prediction assumes constant velocity:

$$\vec{r}(t) = \vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}t$$

The acceleration-enhanced model incorporates kinematic equations:

$$\vec{r}(t) = \vec{r}_0 + \vec{v}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2$$

where $\vec{a} = a(\sin\theta, \cos\theta)$ with $\theta$ being the direction angle in radians.

## Biomechanical Constraints

The maximum turning radius is constrained by friction limits using the relationship:

$$R_{\min} = \frac{v^2}{\mu g}$$

where $\mu = 0.7$ is the friction coefficient for grass/turf surfaces and $g = 9.81$ m/s² is gravitational acceleration. This ensures physically realistic movement predictions.

## Energy Expenditure Modeling

Power output is approximated as the product of speed and acceleration: $P = va$, representing the instantaneous mechanical power. The energy expenditure rate combines kinetic and acceleration components:

$$\dot{E} = v^2 + a^2$$

Cumulative effort over time provides a measure of total energy expenditure: $E_{\text{total}} = \dot{E} \cdot t$.

## Motion Efficiency Analysis

Motion efficiency quantifies how well a player's velocity aligns with the optimal direction toward the target. This is computed using the dot product:

$$\eta = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}_{\text{target}}}{|\vec{v}|}$$

where $\vec{d}_{\text{target}}$ is the unit vector pointing toward the ball landing position.

## Spatial Boundary Effects

Field boundary constraints are modeled through sideline pressure, which increases exponentially as players approach the field edges:

$$P_{\text{sideline}} = \frac{1}{1 + d_{\text{nearest}}}$$

where $d_{\text{nearest}}$ is the distance to the closest sideline boundary.
